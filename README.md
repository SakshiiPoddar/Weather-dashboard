🌦️ Real-Time Weather Dashboard in Power BI
📍 Cities Covered: Puri, Patna, Rajasthan, Guwahati, Kolkata, Ranchi

I created an interactive Weather Dashboard using Power BI, showcasing real-time weather insights for six key Indian cities. This project highlights my data visualization skills and ability to work with APIs and dynamic datasets.

🔹 Key Features:

Real-time weather data integration using Weather API

City-wise comparison of temperature, humidity, wind, and conditions

Clean and interactive visuals with slicers and filters

Drill-down reports for detailed city-level weather insights

Power BI service integration for online access

This project allowed me to apply my Power BI skills to a practical, real-world dataset and strengthened my understanding of API data transformation, data modeling, and dashboard design.

💡 Excited to build more data-driven solutions that make information easy to understand and act on!
